# DNN Media Module

This is the DNN Media module. It allows an end user to be given the ability to manage a specific piece of content on a page. 

It also is used to display how a DNN solution could be architected to be built outside of a DNN webwite, as a best practice, 
which includes several very useful MSBuild scripts.

## First... Thank You

I just want to thank everyone that helps with the project, even if it's just to use the apps being 
built or submit issues.  However, I'd really like to also thank [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). 
The things I build wouldn't be built half as fast if it wasn't for your generous support.  Specifically, 
the following Visual Studio integrations really have saved me TONS of time and headaches over the 
years, and gotten me up to speed faster on other people's code more than anything else I've ever 
tried (even talking to them about it).
