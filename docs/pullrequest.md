# Creating Pull Requests  

Pull requests are required for all people that want to participate in the development process - even if you are a project Collaborator.

## Before Your Begin Writing Code

Please don't just begin writing code. 

First, [create or update an issue](/issues.html). 

From there, we will collaborate with each other and other people in the project. 

Once we all agree on the direction for the update(s), feel free to work tirelessly on your update(s).  [Write your code!](/code.html) :)

## Creating a Pull Request

Please only submit PR's from [branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/) that were created specifically for your update.

Make sure you clearly comment what your updates are, and which [Issues they're related to](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).

That's it... thanks for helping! :)
