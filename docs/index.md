# DNN Media Module

This is the solution for the DNN Media module. It also is used to display how a DNN 
solution could be architected to build outside of a website, as a best practice, which 
includes several very useful MSBuild scripts.

## Purpose  

The Media module allows authorized end-users to add and manage a single media item on a page in DNN. 

The benefit of this approach versus using an HTML module is that the end-user will not have the opportunity to use a toolbar to intentionally/unintentionally break the website design and/or branding guidelines.  

You can give the permission for someone to just edit a single video, image, and other embedded content on the page without worrying about how they might break the website.  

If you need to manage a collection of media items, then you may want to consider using the [Gallery module](https://github.com/DNNCommunity/DNN.Gallery) instead.
